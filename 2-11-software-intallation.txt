    Package managers
        Ensure dependencies are met for software
        Can handle updating software
        Can install new packages, and dependencies

        May be specific to one particular thing
            Ex. the node pacakge manager, pip

    Installing software requires trust
        Need to install using elevated permissions
        Attacks that target package managers have been developed
            Ensure package managers are up to date

    VMs, containers handle dependencies differently
        Just pack the OS or libraries along with software!

    Understand that when writing software, it will need to be installed
