NAS SAN
    NAS - single device open to multiple users
    SAN - multiple devices on LAN open to single user

inode
    Contains info about where the file is
    Does not contain the actual data

Don't keep random junk in

Types of filesystems

    High level concepts
    
        Regular
        Journaling - keep log of changes
        Networking - work over multiple devices

    FUSE
        Simulate filesystems in userspace to create virtual fs

    Need different partitions for different mount options

    async improves performance

    readonly improves performance

    Tar file
        Store multiple files in single stream of bytes to sace space

    inode
        number is fixed at fs creation
        stored in the superblock
            has many backups over the fs
        see slide 34

    file types
        normal files
        directory
            maps to inode
        special files
            things unver /dev
            physical hardware?
        link
            two names for same file
        symbolic link
            points to file location
        sockets
            allows files/devices to connect over network
        Named pipe
            File version of pipe |
            No size
    
    BIOS
        Basic input output system
