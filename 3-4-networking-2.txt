Simple requests on the internet go through a lot of different protocols and
    devices.

We can use packet monitoring software to see what is going on "under the hood"

HW1 Stuff

    Include more detail about
        Problems encountered
        Why a course of action was taken
    
    Format the README better

    Ask about stuff on mailing list
        Start HW early

    Don't provide useless comments

    Write code so it works in any dir

    Use ec2-wait to wait for instance

    Terminate instance after running

    Avoid waterfall code -- assume 80 character terminal
        if
            if
                if
                    if ...

Levels of hardware devices
    Lvl 1 - "Half duplex"
        Repeater Hub - All packets go to all devices on the network

    Lvl 2 - "Full duplex"
        Network switch
            Segmentation
            Bridge
            CIDR
            STP

    Lvl 3
        Router
            Connect multiple networks
            Routing tables
                Accessing other networks
            BGP

Lvl 2 for LAN, Lvl 3 for WAN

DNS
    List of hosts in /etc/hosts
        Can change list of sites arbitrarily

Even simple requests require a number of protocols, layers

ICMP - protocol for errors at the IP layer

UDP - used for DNS lookup
