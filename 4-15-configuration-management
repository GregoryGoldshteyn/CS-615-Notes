I've used some package managers
    Apt-get
    Yum
    NPM

Rancher Rodeo touched on configuration management for Kubernetes
    But I don't think I understand Kubernetes well enough

---Post Lecture---

Single, custom systems are fragile and bad practice

    I get why they call it Rancher!
        Use server ranches, rather than pet servers

Solution - Configuration management

    cfengine
        specify files, template, parameters, commands

CM system does not make specific changes
    It asserts a state

Concept, group resources into sets based on type, functionality, ect.

Good practice, use different CM in different environments
    Test
    Int
    Prod

Idempotence
    Don't care about success/failure
    All we care about is state is unchanged from multiple runs
    Not always as efficient as non idempotent

CM systems are subject to CAP
