I'm a philosophy minor
    I've done a LOT of ethics, including "applied ethics"
        Bioethics
        Technoethics

Personally, I lean towards the cyber-libritarianism side of ethics
    Let people know what they're getting into
    Let people know when there are problems, and how to fix them

    As long as you spell it out for them, users are responsible for thier
        decisions to use software

Software development ethics are not as well developed as other fields
    Medicine, law

---Post Lecture---

    Software ethics are really underdeveloped

    It seems that the UNIX philosophy is pretty good

    Understand that ethical and legal don't always align

    It's up to us to make software development an ethical place
