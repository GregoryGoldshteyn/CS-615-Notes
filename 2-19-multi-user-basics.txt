Unix was developed when computers were expensive, unweildy
    So it was designed with multiple users on a system in mind

Good for managing who is allowed to see what on a shared fs

Permissions change
    Who can see the contents of a file
    Who can change the contents of a file
    Who can run a file

Unix permissions are handled 3 ways
    Owner permissions
    Group permissions
    Everyone permissions

Groups
    To scale setting permissions for many people, give permissions to group
        then add or remove users to group as needed

        Ex. Developers can read this file, but not write to it
            Admins can read or write it
            Everyone else cannot see or change it

    Easier, safer than giving people permissions ad hoc

    Works well for giving daemons permissions too
        Docker daemon

Unix permissions are set by 3 octal numbers that set
    How the owner may interact with the file
    How the owner's group may interact with the file
    How everyone else may interact with the file

Be careful when using sudo
    File permissions are set for a reason
    When being the root user, you may make mistakes

chmod 777 is rarely the correct course of action
