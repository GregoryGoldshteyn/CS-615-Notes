DNS
    Used to translate website names in ip addresses

    Start by asking the top level domains
        com
        edu
        gov
        ...

        And recurse down until we find the correct IP

    Top level domain servers are huge, and distributed through the world
        The bootstap upon which the entire internet is based

    Routing tables, name -> ip, are huge plaintext files that DNS servers
        use to route to ip addresses, other DNS servers, ect.

    Time
        Time sucks
        Use UTC for everything (programmer's GMT)

    Fully qualified domain names include a dot at the end to indicate the root
        server.

        NOTE -- In DNS section above, there is error. We hit the root server
            THEN the top level domain name servers

    Authorative servers
        Have and KNOW the mappings from name to ip
        Root level and top level domain servers are this

    Recursive servers
        Ask other DNS servers for info
        Cache the info for some amount of time
            Day, week, month, year...

    HTTP
        Status codes
            100 - success, but more action required
            200 - success
            300 - redirect
                also for caching
            400 - client error
                you've made a bad request
                ex. 404 - you request something that doesn't exist
            500 - server error
                the server cannot complete request
