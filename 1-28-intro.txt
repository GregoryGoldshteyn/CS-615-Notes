Observations

The four teams seem to have a pairing, dualistic nature with one another
Attackers try to break things, defenders want to protect things
Completionists want everything perfect, usability advocates want everything 
fast

To me, this might work better as a system of elements, rather than colors, 
using the classical Earth/Wind/Fire/Water

Even though the natures are dualistic, each overlaps with another. A complete 
system may be more secure, a well designed UI might prevent user error

I find it weird that systems administration was considered "too physical" for 
Stevens when mechanical engineering students played with steel ingots in class
to better understand different grades of steel.

Computer science can be highly theoretical, but the implementation of systems 
in the real world requires experience with the physical

Questions

A command using pipes was demonstrated performing a complex task using a single
line of code

While this may be handy for an ad hoc process, how do we determine when a 
clever solution is favorable over an easily readable solution?

In addition to interacting with the system through the command line, will we 
also be using scripting languages, such as Perl or Python to perform tasks?

Between this first lecture, and the syllabus, it looks like DOS is out of s
cope for this class. Is that a fiar assessment?
