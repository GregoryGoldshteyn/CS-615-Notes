These are my notes for Systems Administration

Format
    All note files start with the date of the lecture followed by the name of
    the lecture and end in .txt

    All start with what I knew before the lecture, and are divided by a
        
        ---Post Lecture---

        After which, they include what I learned during and after the lecture

    The reason they are in this format, and not the one specified on site
        is because I took paper notes during lectures, and forgot to translate
        them to electronic notes the day-of.
