HTTPS

    HTTP is plaintext
    HTTPS is encrypted
        SSL
        This happens at the application layer
            (HTTP encapsulated in an encrypted package)
    Problems
        Man in the middle is an issue
        Relies on certificate issuers
        More traffic than HTTP

    Questions
        Different in IPv6?
        Other encryption methods?
            Since it's application layer, why not?
        SSH?

SMTP

    Mail is tcp on port 25
    Lots of headers
        Some we see (sender, recipient, date, content)
        Others we don't (content type)
    Can encrypt messages
        Check email provider for details
    Can sign messages
        Certificate authority similar to SSL

    Questions
        Why have seperate mail protocol?

---Post lecture---
    Why different mail protocols?
        Has a different set of built in tools and configuration to make mail
        easier. Sets a standard for mail communication that is usable and can
        talk to everyone using the standard.

    CAP (Security)
        Confidentiality - Only you can see it
        Integrity - Message is immutable
        Authenticity - I am who I am

    Use TLS, not SSL
        SSL out of date

    Start using a password manager

    Certificates for authentication used to be issued for longer, now less
        More secure this way

    Trust anchor
        The first step of boostrapping security
            For TLS, root certificate authorities
